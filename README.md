# XAML island demo

This project hosts a Universal Windows Platform Control in a Win32 application, using XAML island.

Please follow Freists [great guide](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-dev-appconsult/host-custom-uwp-controls-in-c-win32-project-using-xaml-islands/ba-p/1129823) on how to set up the project structure. If you're experiencing weird behaviour when creating controls or adding a property file to your project, switch to the preview version of VS.NET 2019.

The ColorPicker control has been provided by [Tonu](https://github.com/tonuv) (along with lots of testing and support).
